=========================
This progam defines three functions: 

sum(x,y)

range(x,y,step)

rangeSum (start, end)


sum - will give you the sum of two numbers.

range - will give you an array of numbers from x to y, with an optional step argument 
that dictates the increment to use when listing the range. If no step is given, 
the default value is 1. 

rangeSum - will give you the sum of a range of numbers from 'start' to 'end'.
